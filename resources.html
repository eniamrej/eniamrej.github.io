                    <h4>File on time</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you do not file federal taxes or file for an extension by the extension date, you may
                            face fines. State tax filing deadlines vary, so check your state's department of revenue.
                        </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Contribute to your retirement account</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Making a deductible contribution will help lower your tax bill.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, your contributions will compound tax-deferred.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Organize your documents before tax time</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Print out a tax checklist to help you gather all the tax documents you will need.</li>
                        <li>Keep all information that comes in mail, such as W-2s, 1099s, and mortgage interest
                            statements. Do not throw away any tax-related documents, even if they don't look important.
                        </li>
                        <li>Collect receipts and information that you have piled up during the year.</li>
                        <li>To help organize your documents put them folders and group similar documents together.</li>
                        <li>Keep up with the price of the stocks you bought or sold.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Provide dependent taxpayers IDs on your tax return</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be sure to plug in Taxpayer Identification Numbers (usually Social Security Numbers) for
                            your children and other dependents on your return. Otherwise, the IRS will deny any
                            dependent credits that you might be due, such as the Child Tax Credit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>File electronically</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Filing electronically is the prefered way if you expect a tex refund.</li>
                        <li>Because the IRS processes electronic returns faster than paper ones, you can expect to get
                            your refund three to six weeks earlier. If you have your refund deposited directly into your
                            bank account or IRA, the waiting time is even less.</li>
                    </ul>
